## Description

[310. Minimum Height Trees][link] (Medium)

[link]: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees/

A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by _exactly_ one path. In
other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.

Given a tree of `n` nodes labelled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array of `n - 1` `edges` where
`edges[i] = [aᵢ, bᵢ]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes `aᵢ` and `bᵢ`
in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node `x` as the
root, the result tree has height `h`. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height
(i.e. `min(h)`)  are called **minimum height trees** (MHTs).

Return a list of all **MHTs$** root labels. You can return the answer in **any order**.

The **height** of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root
and a leaf.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 4, edges = [[1,0],[1,2],[1,3]]
Output: [1]
Explanation: As shown, the height of the tree is 1 when the root is the node with label 1 which is
the only MHT.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://pic-upyun.zwyyy456.tech/smms/2023-12-26-065357.jpg)

```
Input: n = 6, edges = [[3,0],[3,1],[3,2],[3,4],[5,4]]
Output: [3,4]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 2 * 10⁴`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `0 <= aᵢ, bᵢ < n`
- `aᵢ != bᵢ`
- All the pairs `(aᵢ, bᵢ)` are distinct.
- The given input is **guaranteed** to be a tree and there will be **no repeated** edges.

## Solution

Initially, we designate node 0 as the root node and compute the maximum height $f$ for each subtree. Here, $f(pa)$ signifies the maximum height for the subtree rooted at node $pa$, and $f(u)$ denotes the maximum height for the subtree rooted at node $u$.

The maximum height for the subtree rooted at $u$ can be determined as the maximum among the following values:

- The maximum height for the subtree rooted at $u$, i.e., $f(u)$. This represents the maximum height attainable in the current tree structure with $u$ pointing towards its child nodes.
- The maximum height attainable towards the parent node $pa$, denoted as $g(u)$.
    - $g(pa) + 1$, which corresponds to the maximum height achievable in the direction from $pa$ towards its parent node.
    - $h_{pa}$, representing the maximum height achievable from $pa$ downwards (but not in the direction of $u$).
        - If $f(pa)$ is achieved in the direction from $pa$ to $u$, then $h_{pa} = f_2(pa) + 1$.
        - Otherwise, $h_{pa} = f(pa) + 1$.

Here, $f_2(pa)$ signifies the second-largest height for the subtree rooted at $pa$. Importantly, we require that the subtree associated with the second-largest height $f_2$ and the subtree corresponding to the maximum height $f$ should not share the same child node. Consequently, when calculating $f$, we must keep track of which child node of $pa$ contributes to $f(pa)$. Additionally, we need to compute $f_2$.

In cases where $pa$ has only one child node $u$, $f_2(pa)$ is set to 1, and $f(pa) = f(u) + 1$.
