## Description
[89. Gray Code (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/gray-code/)

An **n-bit gray code sequence** is a sequence of `2ⁿ` integers where:

- Every integer is in the **inclusive** range `[0, 2ⁿ - 1]`,
- The first integer is `0`,
- An integer appears **no more than once** in the sequence,
- The binary representation of every pair of **adjacent** integers differs by **exactly one bit**,
and
- The binary representation of the **first** and **last** integers differs by **exactly one bit**.

Given an integer `n`, return any valid **n-bit gray code sequence**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,3,2]
Explanation:
The binary representation of [0,1,3,2] is [00,01,11,10].
- 00 and 01 differ by one bit
- 01 and 11 differ by one bit
- 11 and 10 differ by one bit
- 10 and 00 differ by one bit
[0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence, whose binary representation is [00,10,11,01].
- 00 and 10 differ by one bit
- 10 and 11 differ by one bit
- 11 and 01 differ by one bit
- 01 and 00 differ by one bit

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: [0,1]

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 16`

## Solution
The formual of gray code is `f[i] = i ^ (i / 2)`;

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> grayCode(int n) {
        int num = 1 << n;
        vector<int> res(num, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < num; i++) {
            res[i] = i ^ (i / 2);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
