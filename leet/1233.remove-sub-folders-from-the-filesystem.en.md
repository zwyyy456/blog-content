## Description
[1233. Remove Sub-Folders from the Filesystem (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-sub-folders-from-the-filesystem/)

Given a list of folders `folder`, return the folders after removing all **sub-folders** in those
folders. You may return the answer in **any order**.
If a `folder[i]` is located within another `folder[j]`, it is called a **sub-folder** of it.
The format of a path is one or more concatenated strings of the form: `'/'` followed by one or more
lowercase English letters.
- For example, `"/leetcode"` and `"/leetcode/problems"` are valid paths while an empty string and
`"/"` are not.
**Example 1:**
```
Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f"]
Output: ["/a","/c/d","/c/f"]
Explanation: Folders "/a/b" is a subfolder of "/a" and "/c/d/e" is inside of folder "/c/d" in our
filesystem.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b/c","/a/b/d"]
Output: ["/a"]
Explanation: Folders "/a/b/c" and "/a/b/d" will be removed because they are subfolders of "/a".
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: folder = ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]
Output: ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]
```
**Constraints:**
- `1 <= folder.length <= 4 * 10⁴`
- `2 <= folder[i].length <= 100`
- `folder[i]` contains only lowercase letters and `'/'`.
- `folder[i]` always starts with the character `'/'`.
- Each folder name is **unique**.

## Solution
We can use hash table to check whether the folder is subfolder.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    bool CheckSub(unordered_set<string> &folders, string &loc) {
        for (int i = 1; i < loc.size(); i++) {
            if (loc[i] == '/') {
                if (folders.find(loc.substr(0, i)) != folders.end())
                    return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    vector<string> removeSubfolders(vector<string> &folder) {
        sort(folder.begin(), folder.end());
        unordered_set<string> folders;
        for (auto &loc : folder) {
            if (!CheckSub(folders, loc))
                folders.insert(loc);
        }
        vector<string> res(folders.begin(), folders.end());
        return res;
    }
};
```
