## Description
[162. Find Peak Element (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/)

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array
contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞`. In other words, an element is always considered to
be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index
number 5 where the peak element is 6.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-2³¹ <= nums[i] <= 2³¹ - 1`
- `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all valid `i`.

## Solution
We can use binary search to solve this problem. Binary search doesn't require monotonicity, actually it only requires dichotomy.
