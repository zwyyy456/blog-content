## Description
[802. Find Eventual Safe States (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-eventual-safe-states/)

There is a directed graph of `n` nodes with each node labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. The graph is
represented by a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `graph` where `graph[i]` is an integer array of
nodes adjacent to node `i`, meaning there is an edge from node `i` to each node in `graph[i]`.

A node is a **terminal node** if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a **safe node** if every
possible path starting from that node leads to a **terminal node** (or another safe node).

Return an array containing all the **safe nodes** of the graph. The answer should be sorted in
**ascending** order.

**Example 1:**

![Illustration of graph](https://pic-upyun.zwyyy456.tech/smms/2023-12-26-065449.png)

```
Input: graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
Output: [2,4,5,6]
Explanation: The given graph is shown above.
Nodes 5 and 6 are terminal nodes as there are no outgoing edges from either of them.
Every path starting at nodes 2, 4, 5, and 6 all lead to either node 5 or 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: graph = [[1,2,3,4],[1,2],[3,4],[0,4],[]]
Output: [4]
Explanation:
Only node 4 is a terminal node, and every path starting at node 4 leads to node 4.

```

**Constraints:**

- `n == graph.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10⁴`
- `0 <= graph[i].length <= n`
- `0 <= graph[i][j] <= n - 1`
- `graph[i]` is sorted in a strictly increasing order.
- The graph may contain self-loops.
- The number of edges in the graph will be in the range `[1, 4 * 10⁴]`.

## Solution
Referring to [topo sort](https://blog.zwyyy456.tech/zh/posts/tech/topo-sort/), but we need to consider `out-degree` rather than `in-degree`.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> eventualSafeNodes(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        int n = graph.size();
        vector<int> in_arr(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int v : graph[i]) {
                in_arr[v]++;
            }
        }
        std::queue<int> in0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (in_arr[i] == 0) {
                in0.push(i);
            }
        }
        vector<int> res;
        while (!in0.empty()) {
            int idx = in0.front();
            res.push_back(idx);
            in0.pop();
            for (auto v : graph[idx]) {
                if (--in_arr[v] == 0) {
                    in0.push(v);
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
