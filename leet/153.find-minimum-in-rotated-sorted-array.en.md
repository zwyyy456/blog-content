## Description
[153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times.
For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

- `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
- `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array
`[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return the minimum element of this
array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n) time.`

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times.

```

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
- All the integers of `nums` are **unique**.
- `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.

## Solution
The array after rotating is like the follow picture:

We can use binary search ,`int left = 0, right = nums.size(), n = nums.size()`, if `nusm[mid] <= nums[n - 1]`, `mid >= k`; otherwise, `mid < k`.

It also works for special cases.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    int findMin(vector<int> &nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int left = 0, right = nums.size();
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] <= nums[n - 1]) { // it means `mid >= k`
                right = mid;
            } else { // it means `mid < k`
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return nums[left % n];
    }
};
```
