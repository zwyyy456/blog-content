## Description

[446. Arithmetic Slices II - Subsequence][link] (Hard)

[link]: https://leetcode.com/problems/arithmetic-slices-ii-subsequence/

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of all the **arithmetic subsequences** of `nums`.

A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of **at least three elements** and if the
difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

- For example, `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, `[7, 7, 7, 7]`, and `[3, -1, -5, -9]` are arithmetic sequences.
- For example, `[1, 1, 2, 5, 7]` is not an arithmetic sequence.

A **subsequence** of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly
none) of the array.

- For example, `[2,5,10]` is a subsequence of `[1,2,1,2,4,1,5,10]`.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,4,6,8,10]
Output: 7
Explanation: All arithmetic subsequence slices are:
[2,4,6]
[4,6,8]
[6,8,10]
[2,4,6,8]
[4,6,8,10]
[2,4,6,8,10]
[2,6,10]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 16
Explanation: Any subsequence of this array is arithmetic.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1  <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-2³¹ <= nums[i] <= 2³¹ - 1`



## Solution

This problem evidently calls for a dynamic programming approach. For instance, let $dp[i]$ denote the length of the subsequence ending with `nums[i]`. To transition from $dp[j]$, we must be aware of $nums[i] - nums[j]$. Consequently, the $dp$ array requires two dimensions: the first dimension represents the index of the array $nums$, and the second dimension denotes the difference $diff$. As $diff$ can be substantial and even negative, we employ a hash table for record-keeping.

Hence, `vector<unordered_map<long, long>> dp`.

Furthermore, there's the requirement that the array length must be at least $3$. Eliminating sequences of length $2$ during the state transition process can be somewhat intricate. However, we can easily remove length-$2$ sequences after computation by subtracting $\binom{n}{2}$ from the result.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    int numberOfArithmeticSlices(vector<int> &nums) {
        if (nums.size() < 3) {
            return 0;
        }
        int n = nums.size();
        int res = 0;
        vector<unordered_map<long, long>> dp(n);
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        	for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
        		long diff = (long)nums[i] - nums[j];
        		dp[i][diff] += 1 + dp[j][diff];
        		res += 1 + dp[j][diff];
        	}
        }
        return res - n * (n - 1) / 2;
    }
};
```
