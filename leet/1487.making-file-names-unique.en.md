## Description
[1487. Making File Names Unique (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/making-file-names-unique/)

Given an array of strings `names` of size `n`. You will create `n` folders in your file system
**such that**, at the `ith` minute, you will create a folder with the name `names[i]`.

Since two files **cannot** have the same name, if you enter a folder name that was previously used,
the system will have a suffix addition to its name in the form of `(k)`, where, `k` is the
**smallest positive integer** such that the obtained name remains unique.

Return an array of strings of length  `n` where `ans[i]` is the actual name the system will assign
to the `ith` folder when you create it.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: names = ["pes","fifa","gta","pes(2019)"]
Output: ["pes","fifa","gta","pes(2019)"]
Explanation: Let's see how the file system creates folder names:
"pes" --> not assigned before, remains "pes"
"fifa" --> not assigned before, remains "fifa"
"gta" --> not assigned before, remains "gta"
"pes(2019)" --> not assigned before, remains "pes(2019)"

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: names = ["gta","gta(1)","gta","avalon"]
Output: ["gta","gta(1)","gta(2)","avalon"]
Explanation: Let's see how the file system creates folder names:
"gta" --> not assigned before, remains "gta"
"gta(1)" --> not assigned before, remains "gta(1)"
"gta" --> the name is reserved, system adds (k), since "gta(1)" is also reserved, systems put k = 2.
it becomes "gta(2)"
"avalon" --> not assigned before, remains "avalon"

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: names = ["onepiece","onepiece(1)","onepiece(2)","onepiece(3)","onepiece"]
Output: ["onepiece","onepiece(1)","onepiece(2)","onepiece(3)","onepiece(4)"]
Explanation: When the last folder is created, the smallest positive valid k is 4, and it becomes
"onepiece(4)".

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= names.length <= 5 * 10⁴`
- `1 <= names[i].length <= 20`
- `names[i]` consists of lowercase English letters, digits, and/or round brackets.

## Solution
We can use a hash table for processing. `unordered_map<string, int> ump`, `ump[name]` shows the occurrences of the string `name`.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    vector<string> getFolderNames(vector<string> &names) {
        unordered_map<string, int> ump;
        for (auto &name : names) {
            if (ump.find(name) == ump.end()) {
                ump[name] = 0;
            } else {
                int i = ump[name] + 1;
                while (ump.find(name + "(" + std::to_string(i) + ")") != ump.end()) {
                    ++i;
                }
                ump[name] = i;
                name += "(" + std::to_string(i) + ")";
                ump[name] = 0;
            }
        }
        return names;
    }
};
```
