## Description
[1615. Maximal Network Rank (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-network-rank/)

There is an infrastructure of `n` cities with some number of `roads` connecting these cities. Each
`roads[i] = [aᵢ, bᵢ]` indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities `aᵢ` and `bᵢ`.

The **network rank** of **two different cities** is defined as the total number of **directly**
connected roads to **either** city. If a road is directly connected to both cities, it is only
counted **once**.

The **maximal network rank** of the infrastructure is the **maximum network rank** of all pairs of
different cities.

Given the integer `n` and the array `roads`, return the **maximal network rank** of the entire
infrastructure.

**Example 1:**

**![](https://pic-upyun.zwyyy456.tech/smms/2023-12-26-065426.png)**

```
Input: n = 4, roads = [[0,1],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The network rank of cities 0 and 1 is 4 as there are 4 roads that are connected to
either 0 or 1. The road between 0 and 1 is only counted once.

```

**Example 2:**

**![](https://pic-upyun.zwyyy456.tech/smms/2023-12-26-065427.png)**

```
Input: n = 5, roads = [[0,1],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3],[2,3],[2,4]]
Output: 5
Explanation: There are 5 roads that are connected to cities 1 or 2.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 8, roads = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[2,4],[5,6],[5,7]]
Output: 5
Explanation: The network rank of 2 and 5 is 5. Notice that all the cities do not have to be
connected.

```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 100`
- `0 <= roads.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
- `roads[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= aᵢ, bᵢ <= n-1`
- `aᵢ != bᵢ`
- Each pair of cities has **at most one** road connecting them.

## Solution
We can use a adjacent matrix to store the graph, to determine whether two points are connected directly. When creating the adjacent matrix, we need to record the number of points which are directly connected with the current point. And then traverse the points.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    int maximalNetworkRank(int n, vector<vector<int>> &roads) {
        vector<vector<int>> graph(n, vector<int>(n));
        vector<int> cnt(n); 
        for (auto &vec : roads) {
            graph[vec[0]][vec[1]] = 1;
            cnt[vec[0]]++;
            graph[vec[1]][vec[0]] = 1;
            cnt[vec[1]]++;
        }
        int num = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                if (graph[i][j] == 1) {
                    num = std::max(num, cnt[i] + cnt[j] - 1);
                } else {
                    num = std::max(num, cnt[i] + cnt[j]);
                }
            }
        }
        return num;
    }
};
```
