## Description
[2681. Power of Heroes (Hard)](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-heroes/)
You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` representing the strength of some heroes. The
**power** of a group of heroes is defined as follows:

- Let `i₀`, `i₁`, ... , `iₖ` be the indices of the heroes in a group. Then, the power of this group
is `max(nums[i₀], nums[i₁], ... ,nums[iₖ])² * min(nums[i₀], nums[i₁], ... ,nums[iₖ])`.

Return the sum of the **power** of all **non-empty** groups of heroes possible. Since the sum could
be very large, return it **modulo** `10⁹ + 7`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,1,4]
Output: 141
Explanation:
1st group: [2] has power = 2² * 2 = 8.
2ⁿd group: [1] has power = 1² * 1 = 1.
3rd group: [4] has power = 4² * 4 = 64.
4th group: [2,1] has power = 2² * 1 = 4.
5th group: [2,4] has power = 4² * 2 = 32.
6th group: [1,4] has power = 4² * 1 = 16.
7th group: [2,1,4] has power = 4² * 1 = 16.
The sum of powers of all groups is 8 + 1 + 64 + 4 + 32 + 16 + 16 = 141.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 7
Explanation: A total of 7 groups are possible, and the power of each group will be 1. Therefore, the
sum of the powers of all groups is 7.

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10⁵`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10⁹`

## Solution
Firstly, when dealing with array-related problems, we should consider whether sorting the array in advance would be beneficial. In this particular problem of selecting subsequences, since the subsequence can be non-contiguous, the order of the elements in the array does not affect the result.

Next, we can adopt the approach of **contribution**, where we consider the contribution of each element as the maximum value to the final result.

For example, let's consider the array $[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$. The contribution of the element $4$ as the maximum value can be calculated as $4^2 \times (1 \times 2^2 + 2 \times 2^1 + 3 \times 2^0) + 4^3$, which we denote as $a_3^2 s_3 + a_3^3$. Similarly, the contribution of the element $5$ as the maximum value is calculated as $5^2 \times (1 \times 2^3 + 2 \times 2^2 + 3 \times 2^1 + 4) + 5^3$, denoted as $a_4^2 s_4 + a_4^3$.

We have the recurrence relation $s_i = 2 \times s_{i - 1} + a_{i - 1}$.

Hence, we can compute the result in constant time $O(1)$, while being mindful of taking modulo to prevent overflow.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    int sumOfPower(vector<int> &nums) {
        int mod = 1000000007;
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        long res = 0;
        long s = 0;
        int n = nums.size();
        for (long num : nums) {
            res = (res + ((num * num) % mod) * ((num + s) % mod)) % mod;
            s = (2 * s + num) % mod;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
