## Description

[950. Reveal Cards In Increasing Order][link] (Medium)

[link]: https://leetcode.com/problems/reveal-cards-in-increasing-order/

<p>You are given an integer array <code>deck</code>. There is a deck of cards where every card has a
unique integer. The integer on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> card is <code>deck[i]</code>.</p>

<p>You can order the deck in any order you want. Initially, all the cards start face down
(unrevealed) in one deck.</p>

<p>You will do the following steps repeatedly until all cards are revealed:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Take the top card of the deck, reveal it, and take it out of the deck.</li>
	<li>If there are still cards in the deck then put the next top card of the deck at the bottom of
the deck.</li>
	<li>If there are still unrevealed cards, go back to step 1. Otherwise, stop.</li>
</ol>

<p>Return <em>an ordering of the deck that would reveal the cards in increasing order</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that the first entry in the answer is considered to be the top of the
deck.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> deck = [17,13,11,2,3,5,7]
<strong>Output:</strong> [2,13,3,11,5,17,7]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
We get the deck in the order [17,13,11,2,3,5,7] (this order does not matter), and reorder it.
After reordering, the deck starts as [2,13,3,11,5,17,7], where 2 is the top of the deck.
We reveal 2, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [3,11,5,17,7,13].
We reveal 3, and move 11 to the bottom.  The deck is now [5,17,7,13,11].
We reveal 5, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [7,13,11,17].
We reveal 7, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [11,17,13].
We reveal 11, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [13,17].
We reveal 13, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [17].
We reveal 17.
Since all the cards revealed are in increasing order, the answer is correct.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> deck = [1,1000]
<strong>Output:</strong> [1,1000]
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= deck.length &lt;= 1000</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= deck[i] &lt;= 10<sup>6</sup></code></li>
	<li>All the values of <code>deck</code> are <strong>unique</strong>.</li>
</ul>

## Solution

This problem can be solved through direct simulation according to the given instructions. The use of recursion is not necessary. Since the problem involves popping the first element, a double-ended queue (deque) is a suitable data structure to use. The deque will store the indices of elements, and we can proceed with the simulation accordingly.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> deckRevealedIncreasing(vector<int>& deck) {
    	sort(deck.begin(), deck.end());
    	int n = deck.size();
    	vector<int> res(n);
    	deque<int> dq;
    	for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    		dq.push_back(i);
    	}
    	int cnt = 0;
    	for (int card : deck) {
    		res[dq.front()] = card;
    		dq.pop_front();
    		if (!dq.empty()) {
    			dq.push_back(dq.front());
    			dq.pop_front();
    		}
    	}
    	return res;
    }
};
```
