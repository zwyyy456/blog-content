## Description
[2363. Merge Similar Items (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-similar-items/)

You are given two 2D integer arrays, `items1` and `items2`, representing two sets of items. Each
array `items` has the following properties:

- `items[i] = [valueᵢ, weightᵢ]` where `valueᵢ` represents the **value** and `weightᵢ` represents
the **weight** of the `ith` item.
- The value of each item in `items` is **unique**.

Return a 2D integer array `ret`where `ret[i] = [valueᵢ, weightᵢ]`,with `weightᵢ`being the **sum of
weights** of all items with value `valueᵢ`.

**Note:** `ret` should be returned in **ascending** order by value.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: items1 = [[1,1],[4,5],[3,8]], items2 = [[3,1],[1,5]]
Output: [[1,6],[3,9],[4,5]]
Explanation:
The item with value = 1 occurs in items1 with weight = 1 and in items2 with weight = 5, total weight
= 1 + 5 = 6.
The item with value = 3 occurs in items1 with weight = 8 and in items2 with weight = 1, total weight
= 8 + 1 = 9.
The item with value = 4 occurs in items1 with weight = 5, total weight = 5.
Therefore, we return [[1,6],[3,9],[4,5]].

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: items1 = [[1,1],[3,2],[2,3]], items2 = [[2,1],[3,2],[1,3]]
Output: [[1,4],[2,4],[3,4]]
Explanation:
The item with value = 1 occurs in items1 with weight = 1 and in items2 with weight = 3, total weight
= 1 + 3 = 4.
The item with value = 2 occurs in items1 with weight = 3 and in items2 with weight = 1, total weight
= 3 + 1 = 4.
The item with value = 3 occurs in items1 with weight = 2 and in items2 with weight = 2, total weight
= 2 + 2 = 4.
Therefore, we return [[1,4],[2,4],[3,4]].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: items1 = [[1,3],[2,2]], items2 = [[7,1],[2,2],[1,4]]
Output: [[1,7],[2,4],[7,1]]
Explanation:
The item with value = 1 occurs in items1 with weight = 3 and in items2 with weight = 4, total weight
= 3 + 4 = 7.
The item with value = 2 occurs in items1 with weight = 2 and in items2 with weight = 2, total weight
= 2 + 2 = 4.
The item with value = 7 occurs in items2 with weight = 1, total weight = 1.
Therefore, we return [[1,7],[2,4],[7,1]].

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= items1.length, items2.length <= 1000`
- `items1[i].length == items2[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= valueᵢ, weightᵢ <= 1000`
- Each `valueᵢ` in `items1` is **unique**.
- Each `valueᵢ` in `items2` is **unique**.

## Solution
Hash table + analog

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    vector<vector<int>> mergeSimilarItems(vector<vector<int>> &items1, vector<vector<int>> &items2) {
        unordered_map<int, int> ump;
        for (auto &vec : items1) {
            ump[vec[0]] += vec[1];
        }
        for (auto &vec : items2) {
            ump[vec[0]] += vec[1];
        }
        vector<vector<int>> ret;
        for (auto &pair : ump) {
            ret.push_back({pair.first, pair.second});
        }
        std::sort(ret.begin(), ret.end());
        return ret;
    }
};
```
