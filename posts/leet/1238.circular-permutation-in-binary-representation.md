## Description
[1238. Circular Permutation in Binary Representation (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/circular-permutation-in-binary-representation/)

Given 2 integers `n` and `start`. Your task is return **any** permutation `p` of `(0,1,2.....,2^n
-1) ` such that :

- `p[0] = start`
- `p[i]` and `p[i+1]` differ by only one bit in their binary representation.
- `p[0]` and `p[2^n -1]` must also differ by only one bit in their binary representation.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2, start = 3
Output: [3,2,0,1]
Explanation: The binary representation of the permutation is (11,10,00,01).
All the adjacent element differ by one bit. Another valid permutation is [3,1,0,2]

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 3, start = 2
Output: [2,6,7,5,4,0,1,3]
Explanation: The binary representation of the permutation is (010,110,111,101,100,000,001,011).

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 16`
- `0 <= start < 2 ^ n`

## Solution
It's the same as [89.gray-code](https://blog.zwyyy456.tech/posts/tech/89.gray-code/), we just make `res[i] = res[i] ^ start`, since `x ^ 0 = x` holds for any `x`.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> circularPermutation(int n, int start) {
        vector<int> res(1 << n, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < res.size(); i++) {
            res[i] = i ^ (i / 2) ^ start;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
