# [2136. Earliest Possible Day of Full Bloom][link] (Hard)

[link]: https://leetcode.com/problems/earliest-possible-day-of-full-bloom/

You have `n` flower seeds. Every seed must be planted first before it can begin to grow, then bloom.
Planting a seed takes time and so does the growth of a seed. You are given two **0-indexed** integer
arrays `plantTime` and `growTime`, of length `n` each:

- `plantTime[i]` is the number of **full days** it takes you to **plant** the `iᵗʰ` seed. Every day,
you can work on planting exactly one seed. You **do not** have to work on planting the same seed on
consecutive days, but the planting of a seed is not complete **until** you have worked
`plantTime[i]` days on planting it in total.
- `growTime[i]` is the number of **full days** it takes the `iᵗʰ` seed to grow after being completely
planted. **After** the last day of its growth, the flower **blooms** and stays bloomed forever.

From the beginning of day `0`, you can plant the seeds in **any** order.

Return the **earliest** possible day where **all** seeds are blooming.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: plantTime = [1,4,3], growTime = [2,3,1]
Output: 9
Explanation: The grayed out pots represent planting days, colored pots represent growing days, and
the flower represents the day it blooms.
One optimal way is:
On day 0, plant the 0ᵗʰ seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 3.
On days 1, 2, 3, and 4, plant the 1ˢᵗ seed. The seed grows for 3 full days and blooms on day 8.
On days 5, 6, and 7, plant the 2ⁿᵈ seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 9.
Thus, on day 9, all the seeds are blooming.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://pic-upyun.zwyyy456.tech/smms/2023-12-26-065316.png)

```
Input: plantTime = [1,2,3,2], growTime = [2,1,2,1]
Output: 9
Explanation: The grayed out pots represent planting days, colored pots represent growing days, and
the flower represents the day it blooms.
One optimal way is:
On day 1, plant the 0ᵗʰ seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 4.
On days 0 and 3, plant the 1ˢᵗ seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 5.
On days 2, 4, and 5, plant the 2ⁿᵈ seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 8.
On days 6 and 7, plant the 3ʳᵈ seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 9.
Thus, on day 9, all the seeds are blooming.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: plantTime = [1], growTime = [1]
Output: 2
Explanation: On day 0, plant the 0ᵗʰ seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 2.
Thus, on day 2, all the seeds are blooming.
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == plantTime.length == growTime.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10⁵`
- `1 <= plantTime[i], growTime[i] <= 10⁴`

## Solution

To commence, let us establish that cross-seeding does not yield a more optimal timeframe:

Let us assume two seeds, denoted as $a$ and $b$. Without cross-seeding, we proceed by either planting $a$ first and then $b," or vice versa. This is due to the fact that when cross-seeding, the completion time for the first seed is delayed, while the planting time for the second seed remains unchanged. Hence, it is implausible for this practice to result in a more favorable timeframe. This rationale extends to scenarios involving multiple seeds.

Furthermore, let us substantiate the necessity of prioritizing the seed with the maximum $growtime.$ This is because the total planting time remains constant. Consequently, at a minimum, it requires $totalplanttime + growtime_x$ time, where $x$ represents the last planted seed. Thus, for the final seed planted, a smaller $growtime$ is more favorable. By tracing this reasoning backwards, it becomes evident that $growtime$ should systematically decrease in a sequential fashion.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    int earliestFullBloom(vector<int> &plantTime, vector<int> &growTime) {
        int time = accumulate(plantTime.begin(), plantTime.end(), 0);
        int cur = 0;
        int n = plantTime.size();
        vector<int> ids(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            ids[i] = i;
        }
        auto cmp = [&growTime](int i, int j) {
            return growTime[i] > growTime[j];
        };
        sort(ids.begin(), ids.end(), cmp);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int idx = ids[i];
            cur += plantTime[idx];
            time = max(time, cur + growTime[idx]);
        }
        return time;
    }
};
```
