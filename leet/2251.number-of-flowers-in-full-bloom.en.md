## Descriptio

[2251. Number of Flowers in Full Bloom][link] (Hard)

[link]: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-flowers-in-full-bloom/

You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `flowers`, where `flowers[i] = [startᵢ, endᵢ]` means
the `iᵗʰ` flower will be in **full bloom** from `startᵢ` to `endᵢ` ( **inclusive**). You are also
given a **0-indexed** integer array `people` of size `n`, where `people[i]` is the time that the
`iᵗʰ` person will arrive to see the flowers.

Return an integer array  `answer` of size  `n`, where  `answer[i]` is the **number** of flowers that
are in full bloom when the  `iᵗʰ` person arrives.

**Example 1:**

![](https://pic-upyun.zwyyy456.tech/smms/2023-12-26-065533.jpg)

```
Input: flowers = [[1,6],[3,7],[9,12],[4,13]], poeple = [2,3,7,11]
Output: [1,2,2,2]
Explanation: The figure above shows the times when the flowers are in full bloom and when the people
arrive.
For each person, we return the number of flowers in full bloom during their arrival.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://pic-upyun.zwyyy456.tech/smms/2023-12-26-65537.jpg)

```
Input: flowers = [[1,10],[3,3]], poeple = [3,3,2]
Output: [2,2,1]
Explanation: The figure above shows the times when the flowers are in full bloom and when the people
arrive.
For each person, we return the number of flowers in full bloom during their arrival.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= flowers.length <= 5 * 10⁴`
- `flowers[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= startᵢ <= endᵢ <= 10⁹`
- `1 <= people.length <= 5 * 10⁴`
- `1 <= people[i] <= 10⁹`

## Solution

Divide the `flowers` array into two arrays: one representing the time when flowers bloom and the other for the time when they wither, both sorted in ascending order.

Subsequently, for each query, one merely needs to determine how many flowers have bloomed by the current time and how many have withered. Given the sorted nature of these arrays, binary search can be employed for efficient implementation.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    int upper(vector<int> &arr, int time) {
        int l = 0, r = arr.size();
        while (l < r) {
            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] <= time) {
                l = mid + 1;
            } else {
                r = mid;
            }
        }
        return l;
    }
    int lower(vector<int> &arr, int time) {
        int l = 0, r = arr.size();
        while (l < r) {
            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] < time) {
                l = mid + 1;
            } else {
                r = mid;
            }
        }
        return l;
    }
    vector<int> fullBloomFlowers(vector<vector<int>> &flowers, vector<int> &people) {
        // 二分
        int n = flowers.size();
        vector<int> start(n), end(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            start[i] = flowers[i][0];
            end[i] = flowers[i][1];
        }
        sort(start.begin(), start.end());
        sort(end.begin(), end.end());
        vector<int> ans;
        for (int time : people) {
            int res = upper(start, time) - lower(end, time);
            ans.push_back(res);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
