## Solution
[781. Rabbits in Forest (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/rabbits-in-forest/
)

There is a forest with an unknown number of rabbits. We asked n rabbits **"How many rabbits have the
same color as you?"** and collected the answers in an integer array `answers` where `answers[i]` is
the answer of the `ith` rabbit.
Given the array `answers`, return the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest.
**Example 1:**
```
Input: answers = [1,1,2]
Output: 5
Explanation:
The two rabbits that answered "1" could both be the same color, say red.
The rabbit that answered "2" can't be red or the answers would be inconsistent.
Say the rabbit that answered "2" was blue.
Then there should be 2 other blue rabbits in the forest that didn't answer into the array.
The smallest possible number of rabbits in the forest is therefore 5: 3 that answered plus 2 that
didn't.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: answers = [10,10,10]
Output: 11
```
**Constraints:**
- `1 <= answers.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= answers[i] < 1000`

## Solution
If we want the amount of rabbits is the maximum, we need to make the rabbits that answer the same number is the same color, if possible.

We use a hash table `unordered_map<int, int> ump` to record for each answer the amount of rabbits that answer the answer, `key` means the answer, `value` means the amount of rabbits that answer the answer.

If `ump[i] > i + 1`, then there is more than one kind of color among these rabbits. The least amount of kind of color is `(ump[i] - 1) / (i + 1) + 1`, for each kind of color, there are `i + 1` rabbits.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    int numRabbits(vector<int> &answers) {
        unordered_map<int, int> ump;
        int res = 0;
        for (auto &num : answers) {
            ump[num]++;
        }
        for (auto &num : ump) {
            // if (num.second % (num.first + 1) == 0) {
            //     res += num.second;
            // } else {
            //     res  += (num.second / (num.first + 1) + 1) * (num.first + 1);
            // }
            res += ((num.second - 1) / (num.first + 1) + 1) * (num.first + 1);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
