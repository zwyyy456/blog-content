## Description
2383. Minimum Hours of Training to Win a Competition (Easy)

You are entering a competition, and are given two **positive** integers `initialEnergy` and
`initialExperience` denoting your initial energy and initial experience respectively.

You are also given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `energy` and `experience`, both of length `n`.

You will face `n` opponents **in order**. The energy and experience of the `ith` opponent is denoted
by `energy[i]` and `experience[i]` respectively. When you face an opponent, you need to have both
**strictly** greater experience and energy to defeat them and move to the next opponent if
available.

Defeating the `ith` opponent **increases** your experience by `experience[i]`, but **decreases**
your energy by `energy[i]`.

Before starting the competition, you can train for some number of hours. After each hour of
training, you can **either** choose to increase your initial experience by one, or increase your
initial energy by one.

Return the **minimum** number of training hours required to defeat all  `n` opponents.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: initialEnergy = 5, initialExperience = 3, energy = [1,4,3,2], experience = [2,6,3,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: You can increase your energy to 11 after 6 hours of training, and your experience to 5
after 2 hours of training.
You face the opponents in the following order:
- You have more energy and experience than the 0th opponent so you win.
  Your energy becomes 11 - 1 = 10, and your experience becomes 5 + 2 = 7.
- You have more energy and experience than the 1st opponent so you win.
  Your energy becomes 10 - 4 = 6, and your experience becomes 7 + 6 = 13.
- You have more energy and experience than the 2ⁿd opponent so you win.
  Your energy becomes 6 - 3 = 3, and your experience becomes 13 + 3 = 16.
- You have more energy and experience than the 3rd opponent so you win.
  Your energy becomes 3 - 2 = 1, and your experience becomes 16 + 1 = 17.
You did a total of 6 + 2 = 8 hours of training before the competition, so we return 8.
It can be proven that no smaller answer exists.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: initialEnergy = 2, initialExperience = 4, energy = [1], experience = [3]
Output: 0
Explanation: You do not need any additional energy or experience to win the competition, so we
return 0.

```

**Constraints:**

- `n == energy.length == experience.length`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= initialEnergy, initialExperience, energy[i], experience[i] <= 100`

## Solution
Actually, training when meeting competitors is also feasible.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    int minNumberOfHours(int initialEnergy, int initialExperience, vector<int> &energy, vector<int> &experience) {
        int res = 0;
        int n = energy.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            initialEnergy -= energy[i];
            // initialExperience -= experience[i];
            if (initialEnergy <= 0) {
                res += 1 - initialEnergy;
                initialEnergy = 1;
            }
            if (initialExperience <= experience[i]) {
                res += 1 + experience[i] - initialExperience;
                initialExperience = experience[i] + 1;
            }
            initialExperience += experience[i];
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
