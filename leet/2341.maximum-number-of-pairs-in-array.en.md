## Description
[2341. Maximum Number of Pairs in Array (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-pairs-in-array/)

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. In one operation, you may do the following:
- Choose **two** integers in `nums` that are **equal**.
- Remove both integers from `nums`, forming a **pair**.
The operation is done on `nums` as many times as possible.
Return a **0-indexed** integer array  `answer` of size  `2` where  `answer[0]` is the number of
pairs that are formed and  `answer[1]` is the number of leftover integers in  `nums` after doing the
operation as many times as possible.
**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,3,2,1,3,2,2]
Output: [3,1]
Explanation:
Form a pair with nums[0] and nums[3] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [3,2,3,2,2].
Form a pair with nums[0] and nums[2] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [2,2,2].
Form a pair with nums[0] and nums[1] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [2].
No more pairs can be formed. A total of 3 pairs have been formed, and there is 1 number leftover in
nums.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,1]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: Form a pair with nums[0] and nums[1] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [].
No more pairs can be formed. A total of 1 pair has been formed, and there are 0 numbers leftover in
nums.
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: No pairs can be formed, and there is 1 number leftover in nums.
```
**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## Solution
We can use a hashtable to record the times of occurrence of each element.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> numberOfPairs(vector<int>& nums) {
        int arr[101] = {0};
        vector<int> res(2, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (arr[nums[i]] == 0) {
                arr[nums[i]]++;
            } else {
                arr[nums[i]] = 0;
                res[0]++;
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > 0) {
                res[1]++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
