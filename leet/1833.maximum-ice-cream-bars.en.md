## Description
[1833. Maximum Ice Cream Bars (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-ice-cream-bars/)

It is a sweltering summer day, and a boy wants to buy some ice cream bars.
At the store, there are `n` ice cream bars. You are given an array `costs` of length `n`, where
`costs[i]` is the price of the `ith` ice cream bar in coins. The boy initially has `coins` coins to
spend, and he wants to buy as many ice cream bars as possible.
**Note:** The boy can buy the ice cream bars in any order.
Return the **maximum** number of ice cream bars the boy can buy with  `coins` coins.
You must solve the problem by counting sort.
**Example 1:**
```
Input: costs = [1,3,2,4,1], coins = 7
Output: 4
Explanation: The boy can buy ice cream bars at indices 0,1,2,4 for a total price of 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 =
7.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: costs = [10,6,8,7,7,8], coins = 5
Output: 0
Explanation: The boy cannot afford any of the ice cream bars.
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: costs = [1,6,3,1,2,5], coins = 20
Output: 6
Explanation: The boy can buy all the ice cream bars for a total price of 1 + 6 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 18.
```
**Constraints:**
- `costs.length == n`
- `1 <= n <= 10⁵`
- `1 <= costs[i] <= 10⁵`
- `1 <= coins <= 10⁸`

## Solution
Greedy algorithm: the optimal way is to buy the cheapest ice-cream each time, we can use a priority queue to simulate the process.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    int maxIceCream(vector<int> &costs, int coins) {
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, std::greater<int>> pq; // small top stack
        for (int &price : costs) {
            pq.push(price);
        }
        int cnt = 0;
        while (!pq.empty() && coins >= pq.top()) {
            cnt++;
            coins -= pq.top();
            pq.pop();
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
