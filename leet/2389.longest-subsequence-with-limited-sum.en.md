## Description
[2389. Longest Subsequence With Limited Sum (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subsequence-with-limited-sum/)

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, and an integer array `queries` of length `m`.

Return an array  `answer` of length  `m` where  `answer[i]` is the **maximum** size of a
**subsequence** that you can take from  `nums` such that the **sum** of its elements is less than or
equal to  `queries[i]`.

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements
without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [4,5,2,1], queries = [3,10,21]
Output: [2,3,4]
Explanation: We answer the queries as follows:
- The subsequence [2,1] has a sum less than or equal to 3. It can be proven that 2 is the maximum
size of such a subsequence, so answer[0] = 2.
- The subsequence [4,5,1] has a sum less than or equal to 10. It can be proven that 3 is the maximum
size of such a subsequence, so answer[1] = 3.
- The subsequence [4,5,2,1] has a sum less than or equal to 21. It can be proven that 4 is the
maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[2] = 4.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,4,5], queries = [1]
Output: [0]
Explanation: The empty subsequence is the only subsequence that has a sum less than or equal to 1,
so answer[0] = 0.
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `m == queries.length`
- `1 <= n, m <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i], queries[i] <= 10⁶`

## Solution
We can sort the array first, it doesn't affect the sum of the subsequence.

Then we can calculate the prefix sum of the sorted array, then we can get the minimum sum of the subsequence whose length is `l`.

Then for each `queries[i]`, we can use `binary search` to get the maximum length of the subsequence.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    int Bfind(vector<int> &prefix, int target) {
        int left = 0, right = prefix.size();
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (prefix[mid] < target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
    vector<int> answerQueries(vector<int> &nums, vector<int> &queries) {
        std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> prefix(n + 1);
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1] + nums[i - 1];
        }
        vector<int> res(queries.size());
        for (int i = 0; i < queries.size(); ++i) {
            res[i] = Bfind(prefix, queries[i] + 1) - 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
