## Description
[881. Boats to Save People (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/boats-to-save-people/)

You are given an array `people` where `people[i]` is the weight of the `ith` person, and an
**infinite number of boats** where each boat can carry a maximum weight of `limit`. Each boat
carries at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at
most `limit`.

Return the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: people = [1,2], limit = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 boat (1, 2)

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: people = [3,2,2,1], limit = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: people = [3,5,3,4], limit = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: 4 boats (3), (3), (4), (5)

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= people.length <= 5 * 10⁴`
- `1 <= people[i] <= limit <= 3 * 10⁴`

## Solution
We should pair the heaviest people with the heaviest peole if the sum of their `weight` is less than `limit`, or we just let the heaviest people on one boat.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numRescueBoats(vector<int>& people, int limit) {
        std::sort(people.begin(), people.end());
        int left = 0, right = people.size() - 1;
        int cnt = 0;
        while (left <= right) {
            if (people[right] + people[left] <= limit) {
                cnt++;
                right--;
                left++;
            } else {
                cnt++;
                right--;
            }
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
