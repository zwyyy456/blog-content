## Description
[188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV][link] (Hard)

[link]: https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv/

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `iᵗʰ`
day, and an integer `k`.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most `k` transactions: i.e. you may buy
at most `k` times and sell at most `k` times.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock
before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on
day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= 100`
- `1 <= prices.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 1000`


## Solution

Firstly, we may categorize the status of stocks into two states: the acquired and unheld states. Given that a maximum of $k$ transactions can be executed, we thereby have a total of $2k$ potential states.

Hence, it is plausible to instantiate an array as follows: `vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(2 * k + 1))`. Employing dynamic programming, this conundrum is resolvable. The rationale behind selecting an array length of $2k + 1$ is to accommodate negative indices when transitioning from known states.

[123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/) and [309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/) both lend themselves to analogous problem-solving approaches.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    int maxProfit(int k, vector<int> &prices) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(prices.size() + 1, vector<int>(2 * k + 1, 0));
        for (int j = 1; j <= 2 * k; j++) {
            if (j % 2 == 1)
                dp[0][j] = -prices[0];
        }

        for (int i = 1; i <= prices.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= 2 * k; j++) {
                if (j % 2 == 1)
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j - 1] - prices[i - 1], dp[i - 1][j]);
                else
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j - 1] + prices[i - 1], dp[i - 1][j]);
            }
        }
        return dp[prices.size()][2 * k];
    }
};
```
