## Description
[1218. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence of Given Difference (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-arithmetic-subsequence-of-given-difference/)

1218. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence of Given Difference (Medium)

Given an integer array `arr` and an integer `difference`, return the length of the longest
subsequence in `arr` which is an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between adjacent
elements in the subsequence equals `difference`.
A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from `arr` by deleting some or no elements
without changing the order of the remaining elements.
**Example 1:**
```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], difference = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [1,2,3,4].
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: arr = [1,3,5,7], difference = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is any single element.
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: arr = [1,5,7,8,5,3,4,2,1], difference = -2
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [7,5,3,1].
```
**Constraints:**
- `1 <= arr.length <= 10⁵`
- `-10⁴ <= arr[i], difference <= 10⁴`

## Solution
We can use a hash table `ump[nums[i]]` to record the length of longest arithmetic subsequence in which `nums[i]` is the last element.

We have
```cpp
if (ump.find(num - difference) != ump.end()) {
    ump[num] = ump[num - difference] + 1;
} else {
    ump[num] = 1;
}
```

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    int longestSubsequence(vector<int> &arr, int difference) {
        unordered_map<int, int> ump;
        for (auto &num : arr) {
            if (ump.find(num - difference) != ump.end()) {
                ump[num] = ump[num - difference] + 1;
            } else {
                ump[num] = 1;
            }
        }
        int res = 0;
        for (auto &num : ump) {
            res = res < num.second ? num.second : res;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
