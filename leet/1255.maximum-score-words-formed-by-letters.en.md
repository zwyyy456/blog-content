## Description
[1255. Maximum Score Words Formed by Letters (Hard)](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-words-formed-by-letters/)

Given a list of `words`, list of  single `letters` (might be repeating) and `score` of every
character.

Return the maximum score of **any** valid set of words formed by using the given letters (
`words[i]` cannot be used two or more times).

It is not necessary to use all characters in `letters` and each letter can only be used once. Score
of letters `'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'`, ... , `'z'` is given by `score[0]`, `score[1]`, ... , `score[25]`
respectively.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["dog","cat","dad","good"], letters = ["a","a","c","d","d","d","g","o","o"], score =
[1,0,9,5,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: 23
Explanation:
Score  a=1, c=9, d=5, g=3, o=2
Given letters, we can form the words "dad" (5+1+5) and "good" (3+2+2+5) with a score of 23.
Words "dad" and "dog" only get a score of 21.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["xxxz","ax","bx","cx"], letters = ["z","a","b","c","x","x","x"], score =
[4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,10]
Output: 27
Explanation:
Score  a=4, b=4, c=4, x=5, z=10
Given letters, we can form the words "ax" (4+5), "bx" (4+5) and "cx" (4+5) with a score of 27.
Word "xxxz" only get a score of 25.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: words = ["leetcode"], letters = ["l","e","t","c","o","d"], score =
[0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: 0
Explanation:
Letter "e" can only be used once.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 14`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 15`
- `1 <= letters.length <= 100`
- `letters[i].length == 1`
- `score.length == 26`
- `0 <= score[i] <= 10`
- `words[i]`, `letters[i]` contains only lower case English letters.

## Solution
We can use a hash table `letters_arr` to keep track of the numbers of letters that can be used when backtracking.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    int dfs(int st_idx, vector<int> &letters_arr, vector<string> &words, vector<int> &score) {
        if (st_idx >= words.size()) {
            return 0;
        }
        int maxnum = 0;
        for (int i = st_idx; i < words.size(); i++) {
            int total = 0;
            bool check = true;
            for (char &c : words[i]) {
                letters_arr[c - 'a']--;
                total += score[c - 'a'];
                if (letters_arr[c - 'a'] < 0) {
                    check = false;
                }
            }
            if (check) {
                maxnum = std::max(maxnum, total + dfs(i + 1, letters_arr, words, score));
            }
            for (char &c : words[i]) {
                letters_arr[c - 'a']++;
            }
        }
        return maxnum;
    }
    int maxScoreWords(vector<string> &words, vector<char> &letters, vector<int> &score) {
        vector<int> words_arr(26, 0);
        vector<int> letters_arr(26, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < letters.size(); i++) {
            letters_arr[letters[i] - 'a']++;
        }
        // 回溯
        return dfs(0, letters_arr, words, score);
    }
};
```
