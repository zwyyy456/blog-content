My reasons for starting a blog are quite simple. Firstly, I want to document the process of configuring various software, so I won't be at a loss the next time I need to do it. Secondly, I want to jot down my thoughts and insights from my learning journey.

I once came across a saying on [Gao Yichao's blog](https://gaoyichao.com/Xiaotu/?book=diary&title=about) : "To learn, read; To know, write; To master, teach."

For the past twenty years, my learning process has primarily been about absorbing information, which worked fine for passing exams, but not much beyond that.

To better understand and internalize this knowledge, I’ve decided to start a blog. It's a way to take notes and organize my learning. Additionally, I hope that by sharing my experiences, I can connect with others who are on the same path, fostering an environment of mutual learning and growth.
